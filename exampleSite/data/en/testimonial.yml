      content : For more than 20 years, we have successfully cooperated as a Law Office with the agency OMNIA Communications. Translations from English/Serbian, as well as from dozens of other languages, were always professional, done as quickly as possible and translated with or without court certification, and involved various professional terminology specific to the legal field. The long-term professional experience of OMNIA Communications is truly worthy of further recommendation and reference.

      content :  We have, for 9 years now, depended on the translation services provided by OMNIA Communications for all our needs as non-Serbian speakers. Mr. Lukic's Agency is fast, efficient, reliable, professional and cooperative. To us, the added value is insightfulness, OMNIA Communications produces translations with impeccable attention to detail, relevant to the field in question and down to specific subtleties with a very high level of rigor. Absolutely recommended.

      content :   In all segments of business today, there is a general lack of dedicated people like Mr. Nenad Lukić, who conducts his business both efficiently and effectively. In addition to being an extremely direct and pleasant person, Mr. Nenad Lukić is a top professional and it is a pleasure to cooperate with him when it comes to translation services, both for my company's business and for private needs. I started cooperation with Omnia Communications several years ago by accident, but we have continued it until today. The speed with which Omnia Communications delivers translations covers even those urgent requests "for yesterday". However, this does not affect the quality in the least, as the translations are done with full dedication and possible ambiguities are identified and resolved in advance. With all that, I can always count on experience and knowledge of national and international regulations regarding the translation of important documents. Sincere recommendations for Omnia Communications.
